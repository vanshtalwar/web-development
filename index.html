    <p style="background-color: aqua;">
        Arm wrestling is not as widely popular in India as it is in some other countries, but it does have a presence, particularly in certain regions and communities. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in arm wrestling as a sport, and competitions and events are being organized across the country. Local clubs and organizations often host arm wrestling tournaments, and there are also national-level competitions.

One of the challenges for the growth of arm wrestling in India is the lack of widespread awareness and infrastructure compared to more established sports. However, with increasing exposure through social media, television, and other platforms, the popularity of arm wrestling is gradually increasing.

India has produced some talented arm wrestlers who have achieved success both nationally and internationally. As the sport continues to gain momentum, it's likely that more resources and attention will be directed towards it, leading to further growth and development within the Indian arm wrestling community.
